# AI-Face-Reconition-Graduation-Project

This project aims to solve some of the problems that arose
during this pandemic , its main purpose is helping with the
recording of the lectures and classes in any education based
establishment . It will do so by using technology to reduce the
number of people needed to record a lecture or class and makes
the process of recording and keeping everything in frame a lot
easier. The project uses raspberry pi , camera , faceRecognition
, ObjectDetection , motors and a mobile application , and it has
more uses in the fields of security and monitoring , as it
implements a motion detection code and it can monitor your
home for unknown intruders or see if your kid is holding a
harmful object (such as a knife) . The codes are mainly written
in python programming language and they are run on the
raspberry pi microcontroller which executes the codes and
initiates the camera and motors to work according to what is
written .
